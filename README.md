# Play What I Mean: FDG 2024 Demo
To run the demo locally, set up a web server at the root of this folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Alternatively, if you don't want to do that, you can just go to the [live web demo](https://pwim-fdg2024.github.io) for the same experience.
